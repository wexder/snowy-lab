Repo base around playing with nixos, nix and flakes. Trying to build my lab partially in nixos and maybe with more.

# VPN 🕸️
Currently I can build my raspberry pi that acts as gateway into the overlay network made with [netmaker](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker).
The sd image is done in a way where the whole config is also transferred and can then be iterated on.
<!-- ### TODO -->
<!-- This has the advantage of having fully configured sd image right away. -->
<!-- To build the image -->
<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- make build-rpivpn -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Snowy deck
Nixos virtual machine running inside Steam deck. This is being used as portable workstation.


## TODO
- [] refactor home manager to use roles
- [] examples for building machines
